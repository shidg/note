# Release schedule

Kube-prometheus has a somehow predictable release schedule, releases were
historically cut in sync with OpenShift releases as per downstream needs. So
far there hasn't been any problem with this schedule since it is also in sync
with Kubernetes releases. So for every new Kubernetes release, there is a new
release of kube-prometheus, although it tends to happen later.

# How to cut a new release

> This guide is strongly based on the [prometheus-operator release
> instructions](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/RELEASE.md).

## Branch management and versioning strategy

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

We maintain a separate branch for each minor release, named
`release-<major>.<minor>`, e.g. `release-1.1`, `release-2.0`.

The usual flow is to merge new features and changes into the master branch and
to merge bug fixes into the latest release branch. Bug fixes are then merged
into master from the latest release branch. The master branch should always
contain all commits from the latest release branch.

If a bug fix got accidentally merged into master, cherry-pick commits have to be
created in the latest release branch, which then has to be merged back into
master. Try to avoid that situation.

Maintaining the release branches for older minor releases happens on a best
effort basis.

## Cut a release of kubernetes-mixins

kube-prometheus and kubernetes-mixins releases are tied, so before cutting the
release of kube-prometheus we should make sure that the same release of
kubernetes-mixins exists.

## Update components version

Every release of kube-prometheus should include the latest versions of each
component. Updating them is automated via a CI job that can be triggered
manually from this
[workflow](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/actions/workflows/versions.yaml).

Once the workflow is completed, the prometheus-operator bot will create some
PRs. You should merge the one prefixed by `[bot][main]` if created before
proceeding. If the bot didn't create the PR, it is either because the workflow
failed or because the main branch was already up-to-date.

## Update Kubernetes supported versions

The main branch of kube-prometheus should support the last 2 versions of
Kubernetes. We need to make sure that the CI on the main branch is testing the
kube-prometheus configuration against both of these versions by updating the [CI
worklow](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) to include the latest kind version and the
2 latest images versions that are attached to the kind release. Once that is
done, the [compatibility matrix](README.md#compatibility) in
the README should also be updated to reflect the CI changes.

## Create pull request to cut the release

### Pin Jsonnet dependencies

Pin jsonnet dependencies in
[jsonnetfile.json](jsonnet/kube-prometheus/jsonnetfile.json). Each dependency
should be pinned to the latest release branch or if it doesn't have one, pinned
to the latest commit.

### Start with a fresh environment

```bash
make clean
```

### Update Jsonnet dependencies

```bash
make update
```

### Generate manifests

```bash
make generate
```

### Update the compatibility matrix

Update the [compatibility matrix](README.md#compatibility) in
the README, by adding the new release based on the `main` branch compatibility
and removing the oldest release branch to only keep the latest 5 branches in the
matrix.

### Update changelog

Iterate over the PRs that were merged between the latest release of kube-prometheus and the HEAD and add the changelog entries to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Create release branch

Once the PR cutting the release is merged, pull the changes, create a new
release branch named `release-x.y` based on the latest changes and push it to
the upstream repository.

## Create follow-up pull request

### Unpin Jsonnet dependencies

Revert previous changes made when pinning the jsonnet dependencies since we want
the main branch to be in sync with the latest changes of its dependencies.

### Update CI workflow

Update the [versions workflow](.github/workflows/versions.yaml) to include the latest release branch and remove the oldest one to reflect the list of supported releases.

### Update Kubernetes versions used by kubeconform

Update the versions of Kubernetes used when validating manifests with
kubeconform in the [Makefile](Makefile) to align with the compatibility
matrix.
